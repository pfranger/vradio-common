Our Privacy Policy:
Welcome to the TuneIn Service (defined below) and web site (the “Site”) of TuneIn, Inc. (“TuneIn”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). The Site is operated by TuneIn and this Privacy Policy has been created to provide information about our company and its content directory, tools, and applications (together with the Site, the “TuneIn Service”) to our users (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth TuneIn’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users of the TuneIn Service.

Information We Collect:
When you interact with us through the TuneIn Service, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: We collect Personal Data (such as name, gender and location) from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the TuneIn Service, use certain TuneIn Services, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever TuneIn collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. We also collect device information such as IP address, geo-location, language, device ID, operating system version, memory and sound card data, and installed media players to assist with providing you technical support.

Location-based Data: TuneIn does not collect your zip code, postal code, city or country unless you choose to provide this information to us at registration. Your general geo-location is collected at regular intervals if you use the Service on your mobile device; TuneIn collects this information to provide content and services that are customized for your geographic area.

By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of TuneIn and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.

Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data: When you interact with TuneIn through the TuneIn Service, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. TuneIn may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by TuneIn affiliates, agents or service providers. TuneIn may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the TuneIn Service. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the TuneIn Service, TuneIn often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. TuneIn may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. TuneIn may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

In operating the Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.

Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:
TuneIn uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. We store your operating system version, memory and sound card data, and installed media players to assist us in providing you with technical support. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the TuneIn Service, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. TuneIn and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the TuneIn Service, such as listening preferences and other mobile application usage information, to help us improve the content and functionality of the TuneIn Service, to better understand our users and to improve the TuneIn Service. TuneIn and its Related Companies may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. Note however that on occasion we send service-related announcements, such as disruption notifications, and you may not be able to opt- out of these communications.

If TuneIn intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.

Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:
TuneIn is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.

Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: TuneIn, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.

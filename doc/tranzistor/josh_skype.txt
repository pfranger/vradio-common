I expect some dilution as we go on, but that's fine. what steps does the merger / takeover involve?[03/04/2012 14:19:32] Josh Eikov: we are putting it all together[03/04/2012 14:19:43] Josh Eikov: doing the acquisition of mediapal at the same time[03/04/2012 14:29:25] Josh Eikov: what are you using as the conversion rate CHF:USD[03/04/2012 14:30:14] chris pfranger: ok. you will take over NINJ GmbH, right? should we shut down ninj afterwards and start a new company in switzerland or keep ninj?  we have to consider tax aspects in switzerland, so I will have to look into what options we have and choose a good one :)[03/04/2012 14:30:58] chris pfranger: current rate CHF:USD is 1.1[03/04/2012 14:31:27] Josh Eikov: NINJ GmbH is a german company?[03/04/2012 14:31:44] chris pfranger: no, the company is incorporated in Zurich, Switzerland[03/04/2012 14:31:51] Josh Eikov: not an AG?[03/04/2012 14:32:29] chris pfranger: no.[03/04/2012 14:33:49] Josh Eikov: we will keep it as is i think that is the best- we want to do a listing on the Frankfurt- so having a Swiss company with age is good[03/04/2012 14:34:16] chris pfranger: I would have 2 AGs that we could potentially use for Tranzistor, one is mine only, one I own 25% of[03/04/2012 14:34:37] Josh Eikov: the GmbH should be fine[03/04/2012 14:35:00] Josh Eikov: tax structure is ok- maybe we move things to Zug[03/04/2012 14:35:17] chris pfranger: the one that is mine is basically my pension plan, but I could convert it quite easily[03/04/2012 14:35:28] Josh Eikov: no need[03/04/2012 14:36:21] chris pfranger: corporate taxes on profit in forch (current domicile of ninj) are I think about 25%, where I live they are about 27 or 28%, in Zug they are between 15 and 18%[03/04/2012 14:36:50] Josh Eikov: i have an ag in zug[03/04/2012 14:36:55] Josh Eikov: its good on tax[03/04/2012 14:37:04] chris pfranger: taxes on capital are very low in all of switzerland[03/04/2012 14:37:40] Josh Eikov: we will get it all setup[03/04/2012 14:39:32] chris pfranger: my parents live in the canton of zug, so do two uncles who run companies. having a zug tax domicile should be no problem at all. we could even set up an office quite easily.[03/04/2012 14:39:51] Josh Eikov: awesome[03/04/2012 14:40:13] chris pfranger: if we add a lot of goodwill or valuation to ninj, we would have to be careful. adding goodwill counts as profit[03/04/2012 14:40:54] chris pfranger: so in zh, we would be hit by a 25% tax on that.[03/04/2012 14:41:16] Josh Eikov: we are not adding more then about 50-75k of goodwill[03/04/2012 14:41:22] Josh Eikov: mostly in asset value[03/04/2012 14:41:47] Josh Eikov: goodwill in the US is a bad thing- especially when we are combining 4 balance sheets[03/04/2012 14:42:41] chris pfranger: also wondering if oli and me shouldn't be owning shares of the final company privately rather than through a company shell. should the valuation of shares go up (which we hope), this is tax-free as private person, but taxable at 25% as a zurich company[03/04/2012 14:43:19] chris pfranger: [we discussed this a few months ago already and I wasn't sure how to do this at the time, now I am quite sure owning US stocks privately in CH is smarter than owning them as a company][03/04/2012 14:43:22] Josh Eikov: you should pass them through[03/04/2012 14:43:47] Josh Eikov: we give to the company but the company passes them through to you and oli[03/04/2012 14:44:00] Josh Eikov: and whoever else[03/04/2012 14:44:16] Josh Eikov: whomever - type to fast lol[03/04/2012 14:44:28] chris pfranger: :)[03/04/2012 14:44:47] Josh Eikov: need to find an office on the Bonhoffstrasse[03/04/2012 14:45:04] chris pfranger: why?[03/04/2012 14:45:18] Josh Eikov: close to Sprunglii[03/04/2012 14:45:22] Josh Eikov: lolol[03/04/2012 14:45:57] Josh Eikov: actually it doesnt matter- Zurich is a really accessible city[03/04/2012 14:45:58] chris pfranger: I am quite close to Bahnhofstrasse (15 min by tram), but rent is actually affordable[03/04/2012 14:46:24] Josh Eikov: Zurich is going to become the EU HQ for us[03/04/2012 14:46:50] Josh Eikov: we are going on a content tear here in the US[03/04/2012 14:47:05] Josh Eikov: i have the deck loaded with a super business developer[03/04/2012 14:47:32] Josh Eikov: we need to do the same with the EU/Asian indie labels[03/04/2012 14:48:35] Josh Eikov: www.indie-music.com  the woman that owns this site is on board as our Director of North American Label Relations[03/04/2012 14:48:58] Josh Eikov: Suz knows everyone- has been in the indie scene since 1994[03/04/2012 14:49:41] chris pfranger: we'll be able to build this up in EU as well. EU is more fragmented due to its multi-lingualism[03/04/2012 14:50:23] Josh Eikov: we need to find a guy/gal who worked for Virgin or Warner Europe[03/04/2012 14:50:24] chris pfranger: same thing in asia, although we have a pretty good understanding of the indian market thanks to virtual radio[03/04/2012 14:50:51] Josh Eikov: do you know our model for the label[03/04/2012 14:50:53] chris pfranger: india is basically bollywood[03/04/2012 14:51:12] chris pfranger: no, please fill me in[03/04/2012 14:51:28] Josh Eikov: we pay them 10% pro rata out of a pool from our gross revenue[03/04/2012 14:51:37] chris pfranger: that's where stars are currently made in india[03/04/2012 14:51:49] Josh Eikov: i spent a few weeks in Goa- love it[03/04/2012 14:51:57] chris pfranger: be it music, dance, acting, ...[03/04/2012 14:52:04] Josh Eikov: and 3 months in Mumbai[03/04/2012 14:52:25] chris pfranger: Goa must be great, know people from there, mumbai sounds like hell[03/04/2012 14:52:37] Josh Eikov: it smells like death in Mumbai[03/04/2012 14:52:47] Josh Eikov: too many people[03/04/2012 14:53:35] chris pfranger: scary place[03/04/2012 14:53:59] Josh Eikov: so a standard channel should make between 800k and 1M a year- we will pool between 80k and 100k for the labels per channel[03/04/2012 14:54:19] Josh Eikov: initally we will go out with 10 channels[03/04/2012 14:54:59] Josh Eikov: a label will make between 30-50k a year in royalty from us[03/04/2012 14:55:39] Josh Eikov: obviously because its a pool the number per label goes down with more content[03/04/2012 14:55:43] chris pfranger: what are the sources of revenue?[03/04/2012 14:55:46] Josh Eikov: its fair dilution[03/04/2012 14:55:54] Josh Eikov: advertising and sponsorship[03/04/2012 14:56:44] Josh Eikov: you need to remember that our Chief Marketing Officer was the CEO of Saatchi and is widely known in advertising[03/04/2012 14:57:01] chris pfranger: will we pay royalty collectors as middle-men or pay royalties directly to labels?[03/04/2012 14:57:15] Josh Eikov: we work directly w the labels[03/04/2012 14:57:22] Josh Eikov: no middlemen[03/04/2012 14:57:38] Josh Eikov: we also pay them for their ecommerce business by using mediapal[03/04/2012 14:57:57] Josh Eikov: they keep 89% of all sales[03/04/2012 14:57:58] chris pfranger: like a revenue share for sold songs[03/04/2012 14:58:06] Josh Eikov: merch and songs[03/04/2012 14:58:11] Josh Eikov: we charge an 11% fee[03/04/2012 14:58:16] chris pfranger: that's very low[03/04/2012 14:58:21] Josh Eikov: 5% for credit card[03/04/2012 14:58:28] Josh Eikov: and 6% for using the software[03/04/2012 14:58:44] chris pfranger: should be attractive for labels[03/04/2012 14:58:48] Josh Eikov: the idea is to make money in volume[03/04/2012 14:59:26] Josh Eikov: the first label we have to work with is www.executivemusic.com[03/04/2012 14:59:34] Josh Eikov: they have 20 strong acts[03/04/2012 14:59:45] Josh Eikov: some well known bands like Alien Ant Farm[03/04/2012 15:00:20] Josh Eikov: it doesnt take long for revs to go north of 1M with that kind of volume[03/04/2012 15:01:17] Josh Eikov: we also want to plan a premium subscription product[03/04/2012 15:01:28] Josh Eikov: this would have bluetooth integration[03/04/2012 15:01:36] Josh Eikov: and no ads[03/04/2012 15:02:15] Josh Eikov: make the annual subscription 15.95[03/04/2012 15:02:28] Josh Eikov: we do not have the huge overhead of the major labels[03/04/2012 15:03:15] chris pfranger: how much does spotify cost?[03/04/2012 15:04:02] Josh Eikov: 9.99 a month[03/04/2012 15:04:10] Josh Eikov: thats over 120 a year[03/04/2012 15:04:14] Josh Eikov: too much[03/04/2012 15:04:41] chris pfranger: major rip-off. based on some wrong assumptions regarding consumer spending behavior, too[03/04/2012 15:04:48] Josh Eikov: exactly[03/04/2012 15:05:13] Josh Eikov: i think once the industry knows we are paying a lot more will come our way[03/04/2012 15:05:14] chris pfranger: people actually like to get more for less in the digital world[03/04/2012 15:07:01] chris pfranger: I think price erosion and arbitrage will lead to much lower prices for content, eventually. right now, itunes monopolizes the market, but one day itunes will be a thing of the past as much as virgin and sony[03/04/2012 15:08:10] chris pfranger: instead of engaging in this serial law suit mania they should just reduce the prices to make piracy unattractive[03/04/2012 15:08:27] Josh Eikov: exactly[03/04/2012 15:08:40] Josh Eikov: that was something i wanted to ask about the player[03/04/2012 15:09:12] Josh Eikov: can we turn the mp3 that it records into a proprietary code that only plays on our player[03/04/2012 15:09:22] chris pfranger: yes[03/04/2012 15:09:28] Josh Eikov: we need to do that[03/04/2012 15:10:09] chris pfranger: although it will be hard to protect it from hackers. they will figure out how to decode the content at one point[03/04/2012 15:10:49] Josh Eikov: there is no such thing as security[03/04/2012 15:11:00] Josh Eikov: any system can be breached[03/04/2012 15:11:11] Josh Eikov: but we both know its about appearance[03/04/2012 15:11:36] chris pfranger: yes.

I guess the competitor has to be comparable to tranzistor[27/04/2012 15:43:01] Josh Eikov: We can never block anybody from making a living but at the same time we need to protect the company.  Yes must be in the same business type as our company[27/04/2012 15:43:45] chris pfranger: point 5.2 was the next point. he again had some points he questioned, I told him to just ignore it and trust me that it is a very common part of any contract of this kind[27/04/2012 15:44:27] Josh Eikov: We all do not know what's going on in the future however I can tell you that you both are very important to the future of our project and our company and we're not looking to have any issues that we cannot resolve quickly.

we either create or buy[04/05/2012 15:22:21] Josh Eikov: this way we are growing a network of channels[04/05/2012 15:22:43] Josh Eikov: that can be laid into Tranzistor Radio and into VRadio[04/05/2012 15:23:24] Josh Eikov: so optimally you guys should do just what you are doing[04/05/2012 15:23:37] Josh Eikov: keep enhancing these products now[04/05/2012 15:23:47] chris

pandora. royalties are killing them[04/05/2012 15:25:46] Josh Eikov: so we finalize this beta[04/05/2012 15:25:54] Josh Eikov: and then we integrate bluetooth[04/05/2012 15:26:00] Josh Eikov: for the car[04/05/2012 15:26:17] Josh Eikov: and then we create little improvements[04/05/2012 15:26:24] Josh Eikov: along the way[04/05/2012 15:26:57] Josh Eikov: and we market using a dual approach[04/05/2012 15:27:11] Josh Eikov: Tranzistor Radio in NA and the EU[04/05/2012 15:27:19] Josh Eikov: and VRadio in emerging markets[04/05/2012 15:28:26] Josh Eikov: we can land sponsors and advertiser that will pay for both- companies like Coca Cola, Ford Motor, Nissan and other global brands[04/05/2012 15:30:10] Josh Eikov: with the value add of having had 4m+ downloads underneath a content network we already are bigger then Pandora and Spotify-  people are moving away from them because there isnt anything interesting[04/05/2012 15:32:58] chris pfranger: ok, that already answers most of our questions. so we'll do this step by step and integrate other revenue streams later[04/05/2012 15:33:20] Josh Eikov: i want to concentrate on radio first[04/05/2012 15:33:29] Josh Eikov: we will add other products later[04/05/2012 15:33:31] chris pfranger: lowest hanging fruit[04/05/2012 15:33:38] Josh Eikov: alongside MediaPal[04/05/2012 15:33:48] Josh Eikov: which you guys dont need to worry about[04/05/2012 15:34:08] Josh Eikov: we will just integrate it in[04/05/2012 15:35:17] chris pfranger: good. we'll just use mediapal services with web service interface[04/05/2012

everyone[20/06/2012 17:26:56] Josh Eikov: if you are a label with 10 artists in multi genere[20/06/2012 17:27:07] Josh Eikov: you will earn more with us then anyone else[20/06/2012 17:27:20] Josh Eikov: the average is .002 per stream[20/06/2012 17:27:31] Josh Eikov: our average is like .04[20/06/2012 17:27:54] Josh Eikov: you would need to play a song 300,000 times to earn with it[20/06/2012 17:28:07] chris pfranger: spotify and co have been raising the average over the past few months, but we still have an edge[20/06/2012 17:28:12] Josh Eikov: what we are doing is paying to showcase the music[20/06/2012 17:28:20] Josh Eikov: which will lead to more sales[20/06/2012 17:28:50] Josh Eikov: we make our money with a combination of sales and branding dollars[20/06/2012 17:29:02] chris pfranger: exactly. plus we will work harder to keep listeners. spotify and pandora have notoriously unloyal customers[20/06/2012 17:29:36] Josh Eikov: absolutely[20/06/2012 17:29:39] chris pfranger: same with last.fm. the automated approach has its limitations[20/06/2012 17:30:14] Josh Eikov: we are providing a hand curated and programmed experience[20/06/2012 17:30:41] Josh Eikov: we also have specialty stations[20/06/2012 17:30:48] Josh Eikov: example would be[20/06/2012 17:31:00] Josh Eikov: the Zurich Symphony Orchestra[20/06/2012 17:31:24] Josh Eikov: we can broadcast their live events and their archives for a ticket price[20/06/2012 17:31:32] Josh Eikov: say 24.95CHF[20/06/2012 17:31:39] Josh Eikov: per season[20/06/2012 17:32:02] Josh Eikov: how many Swiss Nationals would love to listen to that but cant afford a ticket[20/06/2012 17:32:10] Josh Eikov: we make that happen[20/06/2012 17:32:23] chris pfranger: you once mentioned the city specialty stations, such as a Boston station[20/06/2012 17:32:46] Josh Eikov: and given the HTTP server it makes it tremendous to broadcast into the home system[20/06/2012 17:32:53] Josh Eikov: like being right there[20/06/2012 17:33:09] Josh Eikov: we abandonded the idea of city stations- too much foot work[20/06/2012 17:33:21] chris pfranger: absolutely.[20/06/2012 17:33:38] chris pfranger: ok[20/06/2012 17:33:46] Josh Eikov: but if we get 100 of these special stations each with 1000 subs that 2,495M CHF[20/06/2012 17:33:50] Josh Eikov: as an example[20/06/2012 17:34:04] Josh Eikov: it cost us less then 30% to do it[20/06/2012 17:34:26] Josh Eikov: we can bag 1M CHF profit[20/06/2012 17:35:38] chris pfranger: should be possible. pandora and co each managed to be installed on about 5% of all US iPhones as a free app[20/06/2012 17:36:00] Josh Eikov: people will pay for special content[20/06/2012 17:36:57] chris pfranger: if we manage our free app to be installed on 5% of US iPhones, Android, Windows phones and convince 1% of the listeners to purchase the $25 option, that should work out[20/06/2012 17:37:18] Josh Eikov: would be awesome[20/06/2012 17:37:30] Josh Eikov: want to open it up to vradio listeners as well[20/06/2012 17:37:53] Josh Eikov: Kyle and I met impromptu last sunday[20/06/2012 17:38:04] Josh Eikov: he should be reaching out to you and Oli[20/06/2012 17:38:08] Josh Eikov: this week[20/06/2012 17:38:16] chris pfranger: ok. you mentioned bob from mediapal[20/06/2012 17:42:22] chris pfranger: is he from the old mediapal team or a new mediapal guy?[20/06/2012 17:44:35] Josh Eikov: old team[20/06/2012 17:44:39] Josh Eikov: hes awesome[20/06/2012 17:45:09] chris pfranger: give him my skype id (alienbreed), we should talk[20/06/2012 17:47:14] Josh Eikov: hold on i will introduce you[20/06/2012 17:47:25] Josh Eikov: Josh Eikov created &lt;a href=&quot;skypechatopen:24693&quot;&gt;a group conversation&lt;/a&gt;[20/06/2012 17:54:59] chris pfranger: josh, if we have mediapal, what do we need www.bandcentral.com for?[20/06/2012 18:48:20] chris pfranger: so now that I know how we use mediapal, let's look at bandcentral:[20/06/2012 18:55:13] Josh Eikov: sign up[20/06/2012 18:55:15] Josh Eikov: its free[20/06/2012 18:55:21] Josh Eikov: iPhone only[20/06/2012 18:55:51] chris pfranger: do you have an account yet?[20/06/2012 18:59:12] chris pfranger: on a completely different note: how important is the blackberry for us? should I invest time in updating blackberry vradio client?[20/06/2012 19:05:27] chris pfranger: g2g, dinner, chat later this week[20/06/2012 19:05:42] Josh Eikov: ok thanks[20/06/2012 19:05:44] Josh Eikov: enjoy[20/06/2012 19:06:00] chris pfranger: thanks![20/06/2012 21:59:21] Josh Eikov: http://www.moblynet.com/Mobile_Website_Features  please review

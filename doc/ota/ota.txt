OTA delivery
------------

I use a library called HockeyKit on my server to deliver apps 
directly to phones over WiFi.

The URL of the library is https://github.com/TheRealKerni/HockeyKit/wiki

The URL for OTA downloads is http://pfranger.com/iosota

In order to offer an app for download for alpha or beta testers,
I need to copy it into the server directory inside a subdirectory
<bundle id>. The required files are an IPA and a PLIST files.
Example: the file URLs for the tranzistor test app are:
http://pfranger.com/iosota/com.tranzistorradio/tranzistor.ipa
http://pfranger.com/iosota/com.tranzistorradio/tranzistor.plist

The IPA file holds the app (executable, resources, meta-data) and
a mobile provisioning profile. The provisioning profile must contain
the UDID (device ID) of the phone that the app should run on.

Create an IPA file from Xcode: 
  1. product->build for->build for archiving
  2. product->archive
  3. rename the archive to tranzistor (or whatever name you want)
  4. click on share
    iOS app Store Package (.ipa)
    iPhone Developer (currently matches ...)
    Next
    Name it tranzistor (or whatever)
    Select Desktop as file destination (or any other location)
    Select "save for enterprise distribution"
    Application URL: http://pfranger.com/iosota/com.tranzistorradio/tranzistor.ipa
    Title: tranzistor
    Save
  5. copy (using scp) the two created files (ipa and plist) to the server
